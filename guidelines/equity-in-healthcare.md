use "drivers of health" instead of "social determinants of health."
use "equity" instead of "equality." In most of our communications, Blue Cross NC will be discussing the strategic allocation of resources, depending on need.
use "equality" only when specifically addressing the distribution of resources that are exactly the same, regardless of need, or when referring to organization names or causes (eg EqualityNC or marriage equality)
Use "food security" instead of "food insecurity," whenever possible. Try to accentuate the positive we are working toward, rather than the negative we are working to overcome. Avoid using "hunger" as a substitute for "food insecurity" unless specifically referencing the experience of hunger.
Use "housing" or "healthy housing" instead of "housing insecurity" of "homelessness." Healthy housing can be shaped by factors such as stability, quality, safety, affordability and neighbourhod of residence.
Use "families living on low income" instead of "poor" or "underprivilaged" families.
Use "underserved communities" when describing the current state of a community facing inadequate infrastructure and services to meet its residents needs.
Do not use "poor", "vulnerable," "underprivilaged," "bad,""sketchy," "needy or any other adjectives that make assumptions about quality of life or convey a value judgment.
use "historically excluded communities" to describe communities or social groups that have been marginalized for decades because of social prejudice.
"Historically excluded" more precisely captures systematic oppression and its socioeconomic impacts than the terms "underserved or "under-represented."
In general, employ a "People-first" approach to working so that individuals arent defined solely by thier economic circumstance.
Use "people whose incomes are below the federal poverty threshold" instead of "poor people."
